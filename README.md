# Splits.io Mobile App

This is a work-in-progress mobile (Android/iOS) app for Splits.io. It is in an early alpha state.

## Getting Started

The app is written in Flutter. The code base is shared between Android and iOS.

Flutter is pretty easy to get set up. You can view how here: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

In short, you can choose to build and develop the app either from the command line or from Android Studio. If you are familiar with one of those two options, that's going to be the simpler one to set up for you. As a default, I recommend command line. I have tested both options on both \*nix and Windows.
