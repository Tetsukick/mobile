### Overview
Flutter is a platform-agnostic mobile framework by Google that uses the Dart
language for both logic and layout. It's very similar to modern JavaScript
and easy to get spun up on.

The code base is shared between Android and iOS.

You need Android Studio to develop in Flutter, but you don't need to actually
use it -- only have it installed. I recommend Visual Studio Code as a very
good and newbie-friendly Flutter development environment.
